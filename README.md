# Joke Project for the Hackathon [BEZUMhack](https://bezumci.wtf/hack/) üçì

‚ö†Ô∏è This project was created as part of the hackathon [BEZUMhack](https://bezumci.wtf/hack/). The goal was to create the most unusual, funny, and insecure website. This project **intentionally** includes anti-patterns and is full of various vulnerabilities. **Do not take the code seriously!** üö´

## Description
A revolutionary platform for dating with products in the style of Tinder. A service where each item has its own personality and character. üòâ

Website sections:

- üõ∏ Home (products fly all over the page to make it "easier" to choose them)
- ü©∑ Product selection (you can like and dislike products, read detailed information, view statuses. Each product has its own character - just like people)
- üí¨ Chats with products (you can chat with each product on the hottest topics. Each product's response is voiced by an unparalleled voice)
- üõçÔ∏è Adding products (you can list products for sale)
- üîÄ Login and authorization (the username will simply be stored in the address bar. "Security" above all)

Features:

- üéµ Atmospheric music for the mood (music plays on each page, which cannot be turned off)
- ‚ú® Bright and memorable design
- üóÑÔ∏è All data is stored openly mixed - products together with users
- ü§Ø All code is stored in one file. This greatly "accelerates" development
